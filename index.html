            <p>
                Water pipeline management in many geographical areas faces several critical challenges that impact water conservation, distribution efficiency, and public health. One of the major issues is pipeline leakages, which lead to significant water loss and increased operational costs. Undetected leaks not only waste valuable resources but also weaken infrastructure, causing frequent breakdowns. Additionally, illegal water connections and unauthorized usage disrupt equitable distribution, making it difficult for authorities to track and control supply effectively. Another pressing problem is fluctuations in water pressure, which can result in pipe bursts, reduced supply to end users, and damage to household plumbing systems. Moreover, the lack of real-time monitoring and automated fault detection makes it challenging for water management authorities to respond quickly to maintenance needs. Many existing systems rely on manual inspections, which are inefficient and time-consuming
